# #You've bought some stock and now the price is on the rise

# Create a program that:

# Reads the value of the stock at the time of purchase
# Reads the percentage of increase (or decrease)
# Prints the total value of your stock
# Prints the increase or decrease value

# Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
# Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000

# Define the variables
    # price = the current price of the stock
    # price_change = the increase or decrease of the stock
    # total_value = the new value of the stock
